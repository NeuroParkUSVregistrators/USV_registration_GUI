# USV Registration GUI
NEWLY NAMED: "JWI-EAK"

A Julia/Gtk graphical interface for **registering and inspecting mouse ultrasonic vocalizations (USVs)** in WaveSurfer `.h5` recordings.

`Jwi-eak.jl` is the current version of the GUI. On top of manual box annotation, it adds a one-click **automatic USV detection** pipeline (SDTS denoising → time-axis detection → ridge/harmonic frequency bounds) whose results load straight into the editor for review and correction.

## Features

* Load WaveSurfer `.h5` recordings (or reopen a saved `.jld` annotation)
* Interactive spectrogram with a kHz frequency axis
* **Automatic USV detection** with the **USV detection** button (new in temp9)
* Manually draw, move, resize and delete USV bounding boxes
* Per-USV close-up view with acoustic features
* Population histograms of acoustic features
* Save annotations as `.jld` and automatically export each USV as a 128 × 128 JPEG
* Window title shows the current file and an unsaved-changes marker (`*`)
* Keyboard and mouse-wheel navigation

```

Jwi-eak.jl loads only the files listed above from `Necessities/`.

---

## Requirements

* Julia (developed and tested primarily on **Windows**)
* Packages declared in `Project.toml`:

```text
Gtk  GtkObservables  Graphics  Colors  Cairo  CairoMakie
JLD  HDF5  FFTW  DSP  Distributions  LinearAlgebra
Images  ImageTransformations  ImageMagick  FileIO  Interpolations
```

The standard libraries `Dates`, `Printf`, `Random`, `SparseArrays` and `Statistics` are also used; they ship with Julia.

---

## Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/NeuroParkUSVregistrators/USV_registration_GUI.git
cd USV_registration_GUI
git checkout temp9
```

Then, in Julia started from that directory:

```julia
using Pkg
Pkg.activate(".")
Pkg.instantiate()
```

---

## Running temp9.jl

**Start Julia in the repository folder.** temp9.jl calls `Pkg.activate(".")` itself and loads `usv.glade` and `Necessities/...` with relative paths, so it must be run with the repository as the working directory.

```julia
include("Jwi-eak.jl")
```

or from a terminal:

```bash
julia Jwi-eak.jl
```

> When running with `julia Jwi-eak.jl` from the command line, the script exits when it reaches the end. Running it with `include` from the REPL keeps the window open.

A file dialog opens. Choose:

| File | Use |
| --- | --- |
| `recording.h5` | Start a new registration |
| `recording.jld` | Reopen a saved annotation (the matching `recording.h5` must sit in the same folder) |

### Audio channel

temp9 reads **analog channel 1** (`anl[1]`) of the WaveSurfer file by default; this channel is used for the spectrogram, detection and JPEG export. To use another channel, edit the last lines of `Jwi-eak.jl`:

```julia
choice = 1            # set to 2 for anl[2]
# channel_select()    # or uncomment this line: choice = channel_select() to be asked at startup
@time make_gui()
```

## Basic Workflow

```text

              │
              ▼
          Load in GUI
              │
      ┌───────┴────────┐
      ▼                ▼
 USV detection    Draw boxes by hand
      └───────┬────────┘
              ▼
   Review / move / resize / delete
              │
              ▼
         Save (Ctrl+S)
           /       \
          ▼         ▼
       .jld     <name>_jpegs/
```

1. **Load** a recording (startup dialog or the **Load** button). Loading a new file resets the editor state.
2. **Detect** — press **USV detection** to auto-annotate the whole recording, or skip this and annotate by hand.
3. **Review** — step through boxes with `↑`/`↓`; the view jumps to each one and the side panel shows its close-up and features. Fix or delete boxes as needed.
4. **Save** with the **Save** button or `Ctrl+S`.

---

## Automatic USV Detection

Pressing **USV detection** runs, on the loaded channel:

1. **SDTS filter** (`sdts_filter.jl`) — Short-Duration Transient Suppression. Smooths the spectrogram with time-elongated and diagonal Gaussians (to keep tonal and FM components) and subtracts a frequency-elongated Gaussian (to suppress short broadband clicks).
2. **Denoising and time-axis detection** (`denoise_usv`, `usv_whole_2d`) — finds USV onsets/offsets.
3. **Frequency bounds with harmonics** (`usv_detect_2d(...; harmonics=true, harm_kw=HARM_KW_MORE)`) — sets each box's lower/upper frequency from the ridge, extended to include weak harmonics found on an SNR spectrogram.

The console prints the number of detected USVs, and the boxes appear in the editor marked as unsaved.

> **Detection replaces all current boxes**, including any drawn by hand or loaded from a `.jld`. Run it before manual edits, or don't save if the result is not wanted.

### Tuning

Settings are globals that can be changed from the REPL (after `include("Jwi-eak.jl")`) before pressing the button:

```julia
SDTS_ENABLED[] = true     # false = skip SDTS
SDTS_ALPHA[]   = 0.5      # weight of the original spectrogram (1.0 = no filtering)
SDTS_M[]       = 7        # kernel size in bins
SDTS_A[]       = nothing  # Gaussian scale; nothing → SDTS_M/10
```

Harmonic search parameters are in `HARM_KW_MORE` (`usv_detection_3.jl`); detection thresholds are keyword arguments of `usv_whole_2d` in the same file.

## Controls

| Control | Action |
| --- | --- |
| Left drag | Draw a new USV box |
| `Shift` + left drag (inside a box) | Move that box |
| Right drag (inside a box) | Resize: moves the box's second corner |
| Mouse wheel | Zoom time window (0.1–15 s), centered on the current view |
| `←` / `→` | Scroll back / forward through the recording |
| `↑` / `↓` | Select next / previous USV |
| `Ctrl + S` | Save |
| `Delete`, `Backspace`, `Ctrl + Z` | Delete the selected USV |

Box colors: **orange** = selected, **blue** = other boxes, **red** = being drawn, **green** = being moved, **yellow** = being resized.

The selected USV can also be chosen with the slider/spin button in the single-USV panel, and the time position with the slider/spin button under the spectrogram. The vertical sliders set the display intensity scale.

> `Ctrl + Z` deletes the selected box; it is **not** undo.

---

## Window Title

The title shows the loaded file, with `*` while there are unsaved changes:

```text
USV260801_001.h5      ← saved
USV260801_001.h5 *    ← unsaved changes
```

If a callback fails, the title changes to `ERROR: <action> - Check console` and the details are printed in the Julia console.

---

## Output Files

### Annotations (`.jld`)

Saved next to the recording with the same name:

```text
USV260801_001.h5
USV260801_001.jld
```

Boxes are sorted by time and stored as plain `USVBox(x1, y1, x2, y2)` records under the key `"liness"` (x in seconds, y as a 0–1 frequency ratio), with `"y_unit" = "ratio"`. No Gtk objects are stored, so the file can be read without the GUI:

```julia
using JLD
include("Necessities/GUItype_temp2.jl")   # needs XY/UserUnit from Graphics
d = JLD.load("USV260801_001.jld")
d["liness"]   # Vector{USVBox}
```

`.jld` files from earlier versions load in temp9; the y unit (ratio or frequency bin) is detected automatically.

### JPEGs

Every save also exports each USV as a grayscale JPEG:

```text
USV260801_001_jpegs/
  0001_12.3456-12.4012_lowcut.jpeg
  0002_...
```

* Filename: `<index>_<start s>-<end s>_lowcut.jpeg`
* Size: 128 × 128 (stretched, not padded)
* Frequency range limited to **30–125 kHz** inside the box
* Contrast: 2nd–98th percentile normalization
* Taken from the same channel as the GUI (`choice`)

These images are intended for image-based analyses such as dimensionality reduction, clustering, or neural-network models.

## Acoustic Measurements

For each box the GUI shows:

| Measurement | Unit |
| --- | --- |
| Duration | ms |
| Loudness | dB |
| Spectral purity | ratio |
| Mean frequency | kHz |
| Pitch variance | log₁₀(Hz²) |

The bottom panel shows the distribution of each measurement over all boxes in the file.

In temp9(Jwi-eak), purity, mean frequency and pitch variance are computed on the **fundamental band** of a box when it contains harmonics, so harmonics do not skew them. To use the whole box as in earlier versions:

```julia
FEATURE_BAND[] = :box    # default :fundamental
```

---

## What's New in temp9

* **USV detection** button: SDTS denoising + 2-D detection + harmonic-aware frequency bounds
* Frequency coordinates shared between manual and detected boxes (no ±1 bin offset when loading detected boxes; no hard-coded 257 bins)
* Features computed on the fundamental band by default (`FEATURE_BAND`)
* Old `.jld` files with y stored in frequency bins are now converted correctly when loaded
* kHz frequency axis drawn on the spectrogram
* Analog channel 1 selected by default, with `channel_select()` available
* Clearer errors for unsupported file types or a missing `.h5` next to a `.jld`

---

## Notes

* The GUI assumes WaveSurfer HDF5 recordings in the structure read by `wavesurfer.jl`, sampled at **250 kHz** (STFT: 512-point Hann window, hop 128). Check sampling rate and channel layout before using data from a different setup.
* Saving overwrites the existing `.jld`. JPEGs with the same name are overwritten, but images from boxes that were since deleted or moved stay in the folder; clear `<name>_jpegs/` first if you need an exact match to the `.jld`.
